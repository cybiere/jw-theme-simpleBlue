# SimpleBlue theme for JustWriting

This is a theme for static-text blog platform [JustWriting](https://github.com/hjue/JustWriting). It uses bootstrap and jquery to provide a fully responsive blog.

## Example :

You can see this theme in action on [tictech](http://tictech.info).

## Tag Cloud :

The tag cloud uses lucaong's [jQCloud](https://github.com/lucaong/jQCloud). To have various tag font sizes, corresponding to the number of uses of the tag, you must tweak a bit JustWriting core as described [here](https://github.com/hjue/JustWriting/issues/50)
